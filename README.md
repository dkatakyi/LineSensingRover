## Description
The self-driving 2-wheel drive mini robot rover prototype is designed to autonomously control its way through a predetermined course. This rover has features such as: path following, obstacle avoidance and target reading. This robot is powered by a 9V battery that can be placed into the battery holder for rover utilization. Additionally, the rover has easy functionality, as it is turned on by the blue pushbutton. As a prototype, this robot was tested for all its features during the testing stages. The robot was tested on a rectangular track to check for normal operation. The testing process also checked for the rover’s ability to avoid an obstacle on its path. Finally, as an additional feature, the rover has the capacity to read different targets, and then display via LEDs the representation of each target.
